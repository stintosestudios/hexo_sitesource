# So hexo is kindof cool.

I just started useing the node.js powered static site generater called [hexo](https://hexo.io/). I have been running into a few bugs with it, but over all it seems to work well for what I want it to do.

## I like static sites.

Call be old factioned, but there is something nice about just plain old, simple, no thrills static websites. Don't get me wrong though, I love javascript just as much as the next perpeller head, but I love the pease of mind that I get with a website that does not depend heavly on javascript.

If I disable javascript, and go to your site, and I am greated by nothing but a blank white page, I would say you are doing it wrong. I understand that there are many reasons why you would want to do so, but I should still at least see some kind of static structure that informs me that I need to have javascript installed.
