I just started using the node.js powered static site generator called [hexo](https://hexo.io/). I have been running into a few bugs with it, but over all it seems to work well for what I want it to do. I thought I would write a quick blog post about the hexo source folder, and how I am handling my source and deployment. Even if no one reads it, it is important to write about stuff like this for my own notes sort of speak.

# About the hexo source folder

Hexo builds a static web site based off of content that is stored in a source folder. I write my blog posts in markdown, and then run a command that processes the content there into a collection of html files, and assets that are copied over into a public folder. The root contents of that folder is what will then need to be hosted by some means. As of this writing I am just copying the files over to my [github pages reposatory](https://github.com/stintosestudios/stintosestudios.github.io).

# Pulling the source away from the deployment.

I first thought that it would be great to just have everything together in a single repository. That way both the source and public html will all be together in one nice neat little package. However I have chosen instead to keep things separate into both source, and deployment repositories.

So I have two repositories:

* [hexo_sitesource](https://github.com/stintosestudios/hexo_sitesource) (the source)
* [stintosestudios.github.io](https://github.com/stintosestudios/stintosestudios.github.io) (the deployment)

This is the way I am handling it for now, for better or worse.

# step one : clone in the source

Assuming I have both node.js, and git installed the first thing I will want to do is have an up to date copy of the sites source code. I should always have an up to date local copy on my computer, but if not I will want to clone it in.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/stintosestudios/hexo_sitesource
```

# step two : install the dependencies

I do not store copyâ€™s of the node dependencies in the repository however I do store a package.json file that can be used to quickly install everything that is needed.

```bash
$ cd hexo_sitesource
$ npm install
```

# step three : generate the public folder

Assuming that the git folder is up to date, and all the dependencies are installed in the node_modules folder, I should now be able to generate my site.

```bash
$ hexo generate
```

If all goes well there should be a public folder now.

# Running the generated site locally

It is sometimes nice to be able to view the site locally via the http:// protocol rather then file:// to make sure that everything is looking good before deployment. To do this in my source folder I have wrote a simple server.js that can be used to host the site locally via node.js. To use it I just need to cd into the public folder, and fire it up with node.

```bash
$ cd public
$ node server.js
```

# Starting over with file generation.

Sometimes when making a change to the source it might be necessary to wipe the slate clean, and start over. To do this it should go without saying that I need to delete the public folder, however there is also a database file that will need to be deleted as well. After that just call hexo generate again, and I seem to get a clean build each time.

# My future with hexo.

So far I am loving it, I will write a few more blog posts on the subject for sure. I also have a great deal more to learn about hexo, as well as other major time saving frameworks.
