# It's good to Blog.

This is my first post for my stintose studios blog that I will be hosting on github pages. The site will feature the animations that I have made with my HTML 5 animation framework I have made that I call [forFrame.js](https://github.com/stintosestudios/forFrame). I will likely blog allot about that, as well as other things pertaining to javascript, and webdev.

<!-- more -->

I am trying out a static site generator called [hexo](https://hexo.io/). So far I like it allot compared to the old hand coding style of web development that I have been long sick of. I have all ready written some scripts for it that help with automating the process of making a static site, and so far it goes without saying that hexo is a major time saver. I may write about hexo allot in future posts as well.

It will be nice to gain at least a modest following of like minded people, also hopefully writing this blog will force me to become a better writer.
