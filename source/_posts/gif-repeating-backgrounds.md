# Repeating Backgrounds

Something that comes up a lot when making a GIF of mine is to have a looping background. I Often see this kind of thing in about every cartoon ever made, so of course this is something that I run into now and then. After making a few GIFâ€™s I was able to get this simple, but timeless animation trick somewhat solid, and have found that one method of getting it done is perhaps a bit more professional then the other.

# The crude, but effective way.

When it comes to making my animations I don't care that much if things are done in a crude yet effective way. All I care about is that my collection of frames comes out the way that I want it. Once the finished product is furnished to GIF, or whatever container format, sloppy code is fine as long as it gets the job done.

So the crude yet effective way is to just make it so the background image is for the most part seamless but with an additional part at the beginning or end that is the same as the other side of the image. In other words, I make it so I can just simply loop around with the same square area with the use of just one ctx.drawImage call.

# The complicated, but more elegant way

<!-- ![repeating background](/img/footback_1_320.gif) -->
{% forframe_gif collection_1_5_3 footback 320 %}

The above gif should illustrates why this approach is a bit more complicated, but is a little more elegant in that it allows for me to work directly with a single seamless image. Which can be seen as an improvement of sorts compared to that of having the beginning part append to the end of it as I do with the crude yet effective way that I have described earlier.

For the most part I just grab whatever the current part of the background is, however things get a little involved when it comes to looping around back to the beginning. As such at any point in the looping of the background I will need to figure out as many as 16 variables involving that involve getting the appropriate beginning and ending parts of the seamless image, and placing them both in the proper locations when rendering. 

To help with this, I have put together the following helper function.

```js
var backgroundData = function (state) {
 
    var sx,
    draws = [];
 
    // find source x pointer, and scaled version
    sx = (state.source.tw - state.source.vw) - state.source.tw * state.percent;
    x = sx * (state.drawTo.tw / state.source.tw);
 
    // if sx is greater then 0, then we only need one ctx.drawImage call
    if (sx > 0) {
 
        // just part 1
        draws.push({
 
            sx : sx,
            sy : 0,
            sw : state.source.vw,
            sh : state.source.vh,
 
            dx : 0,
            dy : 0,
            dw : state.drawTo.vw,
            dh : state.drawTo.vh
 
        });
 
    } else {
 
        // else we need two draw operations
 
        // part 1
        draws.push({
 
            sx : 0,
            sy : 0,
            sw : state.source.vw + sx,
            sh : state.source.vh,
 
            dx : Math.abs(x),
            dy : 0,
            dw : state.drawTo.vw + x,
            dh : state.drawTo.vh
 
        });
 
        // part 2
        draws.push({
 
            sx : state.source.tw + sx,
            sy : 0,
            sw : Math.abs(sx),
            sh : state.source.vh,
 
            dx : 0,
            dy : 0,
            dw : Math.abs(x),
            dh : state.drawTo.vh
 
        });
 
    };
 
    return draws;
 
};
